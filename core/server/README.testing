# Hints on testing

The test system requires a working setup of the new conenctor config. The config
is in t/config.d and can be adjusted to your test system if required.

These are the prerequisites for running all tests:
* write access to /var/tmp
* write access to t/var/openxpki (autocreated if not present)
* running mysql server on localhost with a user named "openxpki",   
  password "openxpki" and access to the database named "openxpki"

Until the modifications to Workflow.pm are upstream, you need to use
a patched copied available from https://github.com/oliwel/perl-workflow.git
