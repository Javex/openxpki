Please note that the DBI test is also the first test of the DBI log appender.
The related perl module is OpenXPKI::Server::Log::Appender::DBI.

The DBI Tests require a running SQL Server. The credentials for the DSN are 
taken from t/config.d/system/database.yaml. The default is to use a local
mySQL Server with User/Password/Database set to openxpki.

Copy & Paste Solution for your shell:
mysql -u root -p -e "create database openxpki;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON openxpki.* TO 'openxpki'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'openxpki' WITH GRANT OPTION; 
flush privileges;"
